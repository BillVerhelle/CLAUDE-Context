QuickFi Business Strategy

For twenty years, commercial lending has bolted software systems of record onto a hundred-year-old distribution model and called it innovation.
Core banking systems. Lease accounting platforms. CRMs.
They are designed to store, track, and reconcile what has already happened.
The next generation of financial infrastructure is not about recordkeeping.
It’s about execution.

We are now entering the era of AI-powered systems of action, directly serving borrowers by bringing them online—from initial credit application through final loan or lease payment.
A system of action doesn’t wait for employees to:
• re-key data,
• switch between platforms,
• interpret policies, or
• initiate downstream workflows.
Instead, it acts in real time—at the moment of intent—across origination, credit, documentation, funding, and ongoing loan servicing.
Embedded lending enables small and medium-sized business borrowers to self-serve financing transactions end-to-end.
Loan and lease workflows are no longer processed by bank employees on behalf of borrowers. Borrowers initiate, complete, and manage transactions directly—instantly, 24/7/365.
These distinctions matter enormously in commercial lending.
In the $1.34 trillion U.S. business equipment finance market, lending still occurs after a sales process concludes—through disconnected systems, manual handoffs, and delayed decisions. That architecture was tolerable when speed and cost didn’t matter.
Today, transactions are processed by bank employees interacting with internal systems, while communicating with borrowers through calls and emails—tracked in Salesforce and other systems of record. This internal busy-work disappears when lending is embedded and borrower-driven.
Traditional workflows are a structural constraint.
This transition cannot be incremental. It requires abandoning employee-centric workflows entirely.
Embedded lending places financing inside the transaction itself, rather than downstream from it.
AI enhances this model by enabling decisions and workflows to occur at the point of action, rather than after employee review.
Together, embedded lending and AI fundamentally transform how business lending is done.
This isn’t about replacing systems of record. Many will persist for some time.
But value creation is shifting upstream—to systems that:
• put borrowers online end-to-end,
• initiate decisions,
• orchestrate workflows,
• interact directly with customers, and
• and trigger systems of record, rather than the reverse.
This shift is already visible across global software markets.
Having built lending platforms in both eras, we’ve seen firsthand why this transition is inevitable.
At QuickFi, we believe embedded lending—enhanced by AI—will define the next operating model for the $1.34 trillion U.S. equipment finance industry.
